          # Serena MCP and Claude Flow MCP integration is typically handled internally by the Claude Code Action
          # via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). No explicit configuration is usually needed here,
          # assuming the Claude Action is built to leverage these tools when available.
          # If specific endpoints or configurations are required for Serena/Claude Flow, they would be added here
          # as additional inputs, or configured within the Claude Action's environment.
          # For example, if Serena MCP was a separate service, you might pass its URL:
          # serena-mcp-url: ${{ secrets.SERENA_MCP_URL }}
          # claude-flow-mcp-url: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_FLOW_MCP_URL }}
          # The action will automatically detect and use the MCP tools if they are configured and accessible.
          # The prompt for Claude can be customized based on the event type.
          # For pull requests, you might ask for a code review.
          # For issue comments, you might respond to a specific query if the comment contains '@claude'.
